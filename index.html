      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <!-- A brief personal narrative: what drives you, your background, and your professional thoughts -->
       <p>
        -- As a passionate technology enthusiast, I have always been fascinated by the power of coding to solve real-world problems.
        My journey in computer science began in San Joaquin Delta College, where I began honing my tech and communication skills to build programs in Python, C++, Java, and Linux.<br>
        -- I am currently pursuing a Full-Stack Engineer certification on Codecademy to further enhance my skills and knowledge in web development.
        I am also a coding instructor at Whizara, where I teach students the fundamentals of coding and help them develop their programming skills.
        Additionally, I am a robotics mentor at Mech Finix Labs, where I guide students in building and programming robots using the BBC Microchip.
